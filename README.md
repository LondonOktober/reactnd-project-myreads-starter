# MyReads Project

The Udacity MyReads project is part of the React Nanodegree. In the MyReads project, I was given starter code that contained a static bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I used to persist information to interact with the application.

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Once your server is running, visit `http://localhost:3000`
